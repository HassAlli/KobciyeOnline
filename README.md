# KOBCIYE Online Institute of Technology

Welcome to the KOBCIYE Online Institute of Technology website project. This website was developed as a part of the web development coursework project in the second semester of my university.

This static website is designed to serve as an online learning platform for students interested in technology-related courses. It was built using HTML and CSS.

## Features
Features of the website include:
- A homepage that gives an overview of the website and its features
- A courses page that lists the available courses, their descriptions, and instructors
- A registration page for new students to sign up for courses
- An About Us page that provides information about the institute, its mission, and values
- A contact page that allows students to send inquiries and feedback to the institute

This project has been a great learning experience for me, as I have gained practical experience in web development using HTML and CSS. I have also learned the importance of designing a user-friendly interface and more.
